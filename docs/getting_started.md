# Getting Started with PYCAD

Welcome to the PYCAD library! This guide will walk you through the basics of setting up and using our library for medical imaging.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can check your Python version using the command: python --version.

## Installation

### Option 1: Install using pip (Recommended)
You can directly install PYCAD from GitHub using pip:

```

### Option 2: Install by Cloning the Repository
#### 1. Clone the Repository:

#### 3. Install using setup.py:

```bash
python setup.py install
```
or

### (Optional) Setting up a Virtual Environment

Before installing the library, it's often recommended to create a virtual environment for your projects to avoid potential conflicts between dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv pycad_env
source pycad_env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `pycad_env\Scripts\activate`
```

Then, proceed with either of the above installation options.
